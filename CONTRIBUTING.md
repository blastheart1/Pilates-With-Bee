## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

```typescript
interface BookingData {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  classId: string;
  status: "confirmed" | "cancelled" | "waitlist";
  createdAt: Date;
}

/**
 * Creates a new booking for a user
 * @param userId - The ID of the user making the booking
 * @param classId - The ID of the class being booked
 * @returns Promise resolving to the created booking
 */
async function createBooking(
  userId: string,
  classId: string,
): Promise<BookingData> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Use descriptive component names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props

```typescript
interface MemberCardProps {
  member: Member;
  onEdit: (member: Member) => void;
  onDelete: (memberId: string) => void;
}

const MemberCard: React.FC<MemberCardProps> = ({ member, onEdit, onDelete }) => {
  return (
    <div className="member-card">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### CSS/Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Create custom components for reusable patterns
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Ensure proper contrast ratios for accessibility

```jsx
// Good: Responsive, accessible, semantic
<button className="w-full sm:w-auto bg-pink-600 hover:bg-pink-700 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-pink-500 focus:ring-offset-2">
  Book Class
</button>
```

### Mobile Development Standards

- Test on multiple device sizes
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px
- Support safe area insets for iPhone
- Optimize for performance on mobile devices

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
describe("BookingService", () => {
  it("should create a booking successfully", async () => {
    const mockUser = { id: "user-1", email: "test@example.com" };
    const mockClass = { id: "class-1", name: "Morning Pilates" };

    const booking = await BookingService.create(mockUser.id, mockClass.id);

    expect(booking.userId).toBe(mockUser.id);
    expect(booking.classId).toBe(mockClass.id);
    expect(booking.status).toBe("confirmed");
  });
});
```
